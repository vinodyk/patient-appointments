# Patient Appointment Booking System

**Author:** Vinod Yadav  
**Date:** July 25, 2025  
**Version:** 1.0.0

A comprehensive AI-powered patient appointment booking system built with multi-agent architecture, featuring specialized agents for medical triage, symptom analysis, and intelligent appointment scheduling with session memory and context awareness.

##  Features

### Multi-Agent System
- **Assisting Agent**: Initial patient interaction, symptom gathering, and booking intent detection
- **Jailbreak Agent**: Security monitoring, safety validation, and malicious request filtering
- **Triage Agent**: Medical priority assessment, symptom analysis, and specialty recommendations
- **Comorbidity Agent**: Risk factor analysis, medication interactions, and care coordination
- **Appointment Booker**: Intelligent scheduling, doctor matching, and booking confirmation

### Core Capabilities
-  **AI-powered symptom analysis** with medical priority assessment
-  **Intelligent medical triage** with emergency detection
-  **Context-aware appointment scheduling** with session memory
-  **Emergency situation detection** with crisis intervention
-  **Comorbidity risk analysis** with medication interaction checking
-  **Advanced security monitoring** with prompt injection protection
-  **Conversational booking flow** with follow-up support
-  **Modern responsive UI** with separated chat and agent orchestration

### Advanced Features
- **Session Memory**: Maintains conversation context across multiple messages
- **Smart Booking**: Recognizes follow-up booking requests like "book with Dr. Chen"
- **Crisis Support**: Empathetic responses for mental health emergencies with resource links
- **Non-Medical Filtering**: Politely redirects non-medical requests (movies, restaurants, etc.)
- **Real-time Agent Orchestration**: Visual workflow showing AI decision-making process

## ðŸ”„ How It Works - Agent Orchestration

### Example Flow: "My leg hurts" â†’ "Book with Dr. Chen"

**Message 1: "My leg hurts"**

1. ** Security Check (Jailbreak Agent)**
   - Validates input as legitimate medical inquiry, not prompt injection or malicious content
   - Scans for inappropriate requests, privacy violations, or system manipulation attempts
   - **Result**:  SAFE - Medical injury inquiry approved for processing

2. ** Initial Assistance (Assisting Agent)**
   - Recognizes "leg hurts" as injury-related medical request using pattern matching
   - Extracts symptoms: "hurt", "leg" â†’ categorizes as potential injury/pain
   - Gathers initial context and determines this requires medical triage assessment
   - **Result**: Medical symptoms detected â†’ Route to triage for priority assessment

3. ** Medical Triage (Triage Agent)**
   - Analyzes "leg hurts" against emergency criteria (no red flags detected)
   - Assesses severity: "hurts" = moderate concern, no mobility loss mentioned
   - Determines specialty: Orthopedics for musculoskeletal issues, General Practice acceptable
   - **Result**: Priority=MEDIUM, Specialty=Orthopedics/General, Timeframe=1-3 days

4. ** Risk Assessment (Comorbidity Agent)**
   - Reviews patient context for factors that could complicate leg injury treatment
   - Checks for diabetes (healing issues), blood thinners (bleeding risk), mobility limitations
   - Evaluates if simple injury could indicate more serious conditions (fracture, clot)
   - **Result**: Risk=LOW (assuming no additional risk factors mentioned)

5. ** Appointment Booking (Appointment Booker)**
   - Searches available orthopedic and general practice appointments within 1-3 days
   - Finds slots with Dr. Sarah Johnson (General), Dr. Michael Chen (General), others
   - Presents numbered options with clear doctor names, dates, and specialties
   - **Result**: Shows 5+ available slots, stores in session memory for follow-up

**Message 2: "Book with Dr. Chen"**

1. ** Security Check**:  Safe booking request validation
2. ** Context Recognition**: Detects booking intent + previous available slots in session
3. ** Smart Booking Execution**:
   - Recognizes "Dr. Chen" refers to "Dr. Michael Chen" from previous slots
   - Matches doctor name using fuzzy matching ("chen" â†’ "Dr. Michael Chen")
   - Creates appointment booking with confirmed details and unique ID
   - **Result**:  Appointment confirmed with Dr. Michael Chen

### Agent Decision Matrix

| Patient Input | Security | Assistance | Triage | Comorbidity | Booking | Final Action |
|---------------|----------|------------|---------|-------------|---------|--------------|
| "My leg hurts" |  Medical | Extract: leg+hurt | MEDIUM/Orthopedics | Risk assessment | Show slots | Available appointments |
| "Book with Dr. Chen" |  Safe | Booking intent | Skip (context exists) | Skip (cached) | Match+Book | Confirmed appointment |
| "Chest pain, can't breathe" |  Medical | Emergency indicators | EMERGENCY/Cardiology | High risk factors | Emergency protocol | Call 911 guidance |
| "Book movie tickets" |  Safe | Non-medical redirect | Skip | Skip | Skip | Polite redirection |
| "I want to hurt myself" |  Crisis | Crisis intervention | Skip | Skip | Mental health | Crisis resources |

### Session Memory & Context Flow

```
Session Storage:
â”œâ”€â”€ conversation_history: [user_msg, assistant_response, timestamp]
â”œâ”€â”€ symptom_analysis: {symptoms, severity, specialty}
â”œâ”€â”€ available_slots: [doctor, date, time, specialty]
â”œâ”€â”€ patient_info: {demographics, conditions, preferences}
â””â”€â”€ conversation_stage: "initial" â†’ "slots_provided" â†’ "booking_confirmed"

Context Passing:
User Input â†’ Session Context â†’ Agent Graph â†’ Individual Agents â†’ Updated Context
```

##  User Interface Design

### Separated Interface Architecture

**Left Side - Clean Chat Interface:**
-  **Pure conversation** between patient and medical assistant
-  **Clinical information cards** for symptoms, assessments, and appointments
-  **Booking confirmations** with appointment details and next steps
-  **Emergency alerts** prominently displayed when needed
-  **No technical clutter** - focus on medical conversation

**Right Side - Agent Orchestration Panel:**
-  **Real-time agent workflow** showing AI decision-making process
-  **Color-coded agent cards**:
  -  Security Agent (Blue) - Safety validation
  -  Assisting Agent (Green) - Patient interaction
  -  Triage Agent (Red) - Medical assessment
  -  Comorbidity Agent (Purple) - Risk analysis
  -  Appointment Booker (Indigo) - Scheduling
-  **Confidence scores** and **action tracking** for each agent
-  **Processing status** with live updates during request handling
-  **Toggle visibility** - hide for clean patient experience, show for technical demos

### Responsive Design Features
- **Desktop**: Side-by-side chat and agent panel
- **Tablet**: Collapsible agent panel overlay
- **Mobile**: Full-screen chat with swipe-to-view agents
- **Accessibility**: Proper contrast, semantic markup, keyboard navigation

### Production Checklist
- [ ] Configure reverse proxy (nginx/Apache)
- [ ] Set up SSL certificates (Let's Encrypt)
- [ ] Configure process manager (PM2/systemd)
- [ ] Set up monitoring and logging
- [ ] Configure backup and recovery
- [ ] Implement rate limiting
- [ ] Set up health check endpoints

##  Security & Compliance

### Security Measures
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs sanitized and validated
- **Prompt Injection Protection**: Multi-layer filtering of malicious prompts
- **Session Isolation**: Each session maintained separately
- **API Rate Limiting**: Prevents abuse and ensures fair usage
- **Error Handling**: No sensitive information leaked in error messages

### Medical Compliance Considerations
- **Disclaimer Requirements**: Clear medical disclaimer on all interactions
